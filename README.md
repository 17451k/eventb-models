# List of Event-B models

All models are stored as zip archives that can be imported into [Rodin](http://www.event-b.org/install.html). Also there are txt versions of the models generated by [eventb-to-txt](https://github.com/17451k/eventb-to-txt) script, which can be used to view the code of the models without Rodin.

* [binary search algorithm](binary-search)
* [controlling cars on a bridge](cars-on-bridge)
